1. Start by adding **TweenManager** to your text.
2. Bind the text to **Text** property.
3. Add modifier components to a game object and add them to the list of **Modifiers**. Re-arrange the modifiers to change the order of modification.
4. By changing the **Offset** value, you can adjust the char animation overlap. '0' for all letters animating together, '1' for all letters to animate one by one.
